# RGB-LED Lesson 0 – The Absolute Basics GPIO

This lesson is directly based on the supplied material contained within the User Manual of the RGB-LED Kit.

If you have the kit and have already completed the manual, then you may wish to skip to the bottom and try the “extra credit” exercises and move onto Lesson 1.

## Basic Programming:
Within these instructions, we shall only cover some very basic programming, more detailed examples and tutorials will be made available from the “Meltwater Raspberry Pi Hardware” site [http://pihw.wordpress.com/](http://pihw.wordpress.com/) in the learning section.

It is highly recommended that you take the time to type coding examples in yourself (even if the source is available).  By doing so you will become familiar with the syntax and format of the commands and you will learn it far quicker than if you cut and pasted it.

### Setup:

#### Hardware Connections:

Unless specified otherwise, the guides and tutorials will assume you have your board wired up as follows (although we should always aim to make it easy in our programs to adapt the wiring if required).

| **RGB LED**     |     |     |     |     | 01  |     | 02  | 03  |     | 04  |     |     |
